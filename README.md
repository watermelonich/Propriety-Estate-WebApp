# Propriety Estate WebApp

A modern Propriety Estate WebApp made with ReactJS

# Getting started

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have installed [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm).
- You have installed a code editor like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## Project Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/watermelonich/Propriety-Estate-WebApp.git
    cd Propriety-Estate-WebApp
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Running the Development Server

To start the development server and open the project in your default web browser, run:

```bash
npm start
```

This runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Building for Production

To build the app for production to the `build` folder, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command bundles the React app in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified, and the filenames include hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed!
